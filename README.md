# CATS22Present

Displays content on the secondary screen. Designed for the CAT S22 but technically compatible with any android 11+ device. 
This App is aimed at aftermarket ROMs - there is a lite version for stock ROMs that is significantly simpier and more reliable. See here: https://github.com/B-CyberFunker/S22Present-Lite

It can:
- Display the time/date on the secondary display. 
- Display a notification text and title on the secondary display.
- Display a visualiser.
- Be customized in some ways including background, visualiser style, and font, as well as presets for all 3.

Has some significant limitations at the moment, including: 
- Potentially non-functional on A14 and/or LOS. 
- Not able to override the secondary screen powerstate. Currently the device is woken up to turn the screen on, but this turns both screens on.
- Not able to display on a "Secure" lock screen. Any pins, patterns, or passwords will cause a padlock to display.
- Doesn't have proper system permissions.
- Only stores the most recent notification and the most recent music notification.
