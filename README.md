# CATS22Present

Displays content on the secondary screen. Designed for the CAT S22 but technically compatible with any android 11+ device. 

Has some significant limitations at the moment, including: 
- Potentially non-functional on A14 and/or LOS. 
- Not able to override the secondary screen powerstate. Currently the device is woken up to turn the screen on, but this turns both screens on.
- Not able to display on a "Secure" lock screen. Any pins, patterns, or passwords will cause a padlock to display.
- Doesn't have proper system permissions.
- Only stores the most recent notification and the most recent music notification.
